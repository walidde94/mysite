## Development Setup

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Style Guides

### JavaScript Style Guide
- Use ES6+ features
- Use meaningful variable names
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Calculate daily carbon footprint
 * @param {Object} lifestyle - User's lifestyle data
 * @returns {Number} Daily CO2 emissions in kg
 */
function calculateFootprint(lifestyle) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Vue.js Style Guide
- Use composition API with `<script setup>`
- Keep components small and focused
- Use props validation
- Emit events for parent communication

### Python Style Guide
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Write docstrings for functions
- Keep functions focused and small

Example:
```python
def calculate_emissions(distance: float, mode: str) -> float:
    """
    Calculate transportation emissions.
    
    Args:
        distance: Distance traveled in km
        mode: Transportation mode
        
    Returns:
        CO2 emissions in kg
    """
    # Implementation
```

### Git Commit Messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests
